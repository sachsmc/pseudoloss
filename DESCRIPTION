Description: Utilities for optimization and prediction of the cumulative incidence 
        of a possibly right-censored event history endpoint at a fixed time horizon. 
        Pseudo-observations are a way to deal with censored event history data,
        such as standard survival endpoints, competing risks, and general multi-state
        models. By pre-processing the censored observations, they can be used directly
        in models for continuous outcomes. We additionally provide a set of utilities
        for calculating and optimizing the time dependent area under the ROC curve 
        that is calculated using pseudo observations for the cumulative incidence.
